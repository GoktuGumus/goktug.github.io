## Work Experience
**Software Engineer @ Toucan Code Labs (March 2024 - Present)**
  - Embedded system desing and development with using WPF .NET 8 Framework
  - Maintain code bases and implement new features/endpoints for existing .Net projects using C#.
  - Using tools like Azure DevOps and Trello to track bugs, new features, and software development milestones.
    
## Projects
  - ### AccuFire
      - A desktop application developed with WPF to provide remote control from ground station.
      - Backend development by using C# .NET 8 Framework.
      - Managing threads using async method and managing multi threading with Mutex/Semaphore methods.
      - To provide communication between the device, which uses ARM-based microprocessors (STM32), and the computer.
      - Manage connection control and data flow through COM ports.
      - Developing on the simulation box to control the switches, manage switch connections and show real-time warning screens to the user.
      - Showing the data flow to the user on the graph and debugging.
        
  - ### AccuComp
      - Using dsPIC33FJ256MC710A-I/PF, I developed an algorithm that applies lossless compression by dividing data from a 60-leg MAC processor into chunks.
      - I developed it in C++ and then moved it to C to combine it with hardware and increase efficiency.
      - I losslessly compressed 60 incoming data every 10 ms, saving 65% of space.
      - This compression process takes place in the range of 1-2 ms on average. Then the decompression process is applied again in a lossless manner.
      - The methods I used while developing the Custom Compression Algorithm and Decompression Algorithm are listed below: 
          - Data Normalization
          - Delta Coding
          - Adaptive Huffman Coding
          - Adaptive Huffman Decoding
          - Delta Decoding
          - Data Denormalization
      - At the end of the process, I provided the user with log files containing information such as the original size of the compressed data, the post-compression size, the post-decompressed size, the consistency between the original data and the decompressed data, and the total space saved.

  - ### TOGG Coat Painting Station Information Platform
      - A web application developed for tracking the processes of painting, cleaning and drying the coats of Togg brand cars and displaying the problems on the screen.
      - Dynamically fetching and displaying datas from database by using PostgreSQL and Javascript.
      - Frontend development by using HTML CSS and JavaScript.
        
  - ### TALIA
      - I took part in the following stages in the development of the software of the unmanned aerial vehicle capable of fully autonomous vertical landing and take-off:
        - Image processing.
        - Realtime image recording and high FPS streaming from ground station.
        - Full autonomous flight.
        - Path and Vehicle detecting and tracking.
